The valley unfolds like a painting brushed with breath and mist. Early summer dew glistens on the yeddo spruces and rice paddies, where a century of silence has reigned, broken only by the rustling of leaves and the songs of birds. Now, that peace is shattered as a dark figure materializes on the horizon. Standing at the edge of the earthen slopes – an emerald cradle – stands a person, nearly seven feet tall, clad in black samurai armor and wielding a naginata, his face hidden behind a red Oni mask. He gazes down at the valley, his breath spurting out in thick, gray plumes as he begins to descend toward the village nestled by the river below.

Early sunlight spills gold through the clouds, only to be dissolved into a muted twilight as it bathes the Jizō statues lining the main road to the village. This idyllic scene feels somehow…staged, a perfect tableau plucked from a history book.

Tora (とら) was already cooking breakfast for herself and her brother, Ritsu (りつ). Without warning, Ritsu snatched a zaru (a bamboo colander) and, with lightning speed, swung it toward Tora's head. Without even glancing back, Tora unfurled a makisu (a bamboo mat), catching the zaru mid-swing. As siblings in their late teens, they found endless amusement in testing each other's martial arts prowess. This playful exchange, like everything else, has the slightly artificial quality of a memory.

Tora smirked, never pausing in her cooking. "You still lack speed, Ritsu." She flicked the zaru back at him, and he barely managed to dodge it. "You're getting better, Ritsu," she conceded, smiling. "But you still need to work on your balance." She paused, inhaling deeply as she checked the aroma of the dish cooking over the fire.

Ritsu: (Mocking her serious voice) "You still lack speed, Ritsu… And oooh, you still need to work on your balance!"

Tora: "Do you remember when Father…"

The rest of the sentence died in her throat as the sounds of the village erupted – a cacophony that quickly resolved into terrified screams, angry shouts, and the heart-wrenching cries of the people – abruptly shattering the morning's peace. This sudden violence feels jarring, a tear in the fabric of a serene dream.

Ritsu: "Bandits!"

They raced into their bedroom, shoved tables aside to reveal a false wall, and grabbed their katanas.

Then both siblings burst out of the house, their swords glinting in the morning light amidst the chaos and confusion.

The siblings sprang into action, swiftly dispatching four bandits who stood in their way.

Tora: "Ritsu, we need to get people out of here! Lead as many as you can through the east side of the village. I'll try to slow them down."

Ritsu: "Just… don't get yourself killed, Big Sis."

Tora: "Just go! Protect them."

Amidst the chaos, Ritsu led roughly fifteen people through the east side of the village, while Tora held off the bandits on the other side.

As Ritsu and the others reached the outskirts of the village, their escape was cut off by the towering black samurai. Ritsu watched in horror as the samurai slaughtered five people with a single sweep of his naginata. The scene unfolded with the exaggerated brutality of a nightmare.

Ritsu: "Spread out and flee, people! Don't look back! Don't look back!"

The people scattered, their screams echoing through the village.

Ritsu adopted a fighting stance, ready to face the samurai. The black samurai, seemingly unfazed by Ritsu's presence, exhaled a stream of vaporous breath in thick, gray plumes.

The samurai swept his naginata through the air, the blade missing Ritsu by mere millimeters. The force of the stroke cleaved a Jizō statue in two behind him.

Then the samurai attacked again, this time aiming for Ritsu's head. Ritsu deflected the blow with his katana, but the force behind the samurai's strike was overwhelming.

Ritsu stumbled backward, his katana slipping from his grasp. He closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and released his fear and anger. Then, opening his eyes, he charged at the black samurai. With a burst of speed, he managed to slash the samurai's shoulder.

The black samurai retaliated, striking Ritsu's chest with the naginata's shaft and sending him flying backward. Ritsu crashed to the ground, his katana still clutched in his hand. The black samurai advanced, eager to end the fight, and unleashed a sweeping blow at the fallen warrior.

Midair, Tora's katana flashed, intercepting the samurai's attack. She unleashed a flurry of strikes, each aimed at a different vital point. The samurai parried each blow, but Tora's speed and agility kept him on the defensive. Ritsu, now back on his feet, rejoined the fray.

Tora: "Why didn't you tell me this was where all the fun was? And what did I tell you about… balance, little brother?"

The black samurai stood his ground against the two siblings. He swept his naginata low, aiming for Tora's legs – only for her to cleave the weapon in two with a single stroke of her katana.

Ritsu saw an opening – the samurai's exposed neck. He lunged forward, his katana poised to deliver the final blow, but with a swift movement, the samurai struck Ritsu's neck with the broken shaft of the naginata, sending him sprawling.

With a swift move, Tora seized the samurai's wrist, wrenching the bladed head of the broken naginata from his grasp.

But the black samurai wasn't finished. He hefted the cleaved Jizō statue and hurled it at Tora, aiming for her head. She dodged the worst of it, but the statue still clipped her shoulder and chest, sending her staggering.

The black samurai stalked toward Tora, seizing her throat in his grip and lifting her off the ground. She clawed at his hand, but he held her aloft, his grip unyielding. For the first time, she saw his eyes – twin embers of burning rage. Then, a mystical realization washed over her as she gazed into the depths of that brutal fury: she ceased her struggle, flooding her spirit with inner peace. The world seemed to hold its breath, waiting.

Ritsu awoke to see the black samurai throttling Tora. Fueled by a surge of hatred and love for his sister, he scrambled to his feet, snatched up his katana and the bladed head of the naginata, and charged.

He thrust the naginata blade toward the samurai's chest, aiming for his heart, then swung his katana, attempting to sever the arm that gripped Tora's throat.

But all was for naught: the naginata blade pierced the samurai's heart, yet the katana's strike failed to so much as scratch his arm – as if his flesh were forged from the strongest steel.

With his free hand, the black samurai delivered a crushing blow to Ritsu's gut, leaving him gasping for air on his knees.

Tora, struggling to breathe, turned her gaze toward Ritsu, tears streaming down her face.

Tora: "Ritsu… I'm sorry I didn't see this sooner."

Ritsu: "Tora, I'm sorry I couldn't save you… He's too strong."

Tora: "Ritsu, I understand now… This is all just a dream. You and I are nothing more than characters in someone else's dream."

Ritsu: "What…?"

The black samurai tightened his grip, his fingers digging into Tora's throat.

Tora: "Ritsu… it's a dream… anything is possible… Protect them."

Then, a sharp crack echoed through the valley, and the black samurai's grip slackened, Tora's body slumping to the ground.

Ritsu (whispering to himself): "It's just a dream… It's just a dream… I'm just a part of it… I'm just a part of it…"

Ritsu closed his eyes, took a deep breath, released his pain and fear… and opened them again to find he had, inexplicably, caught the black samurai's fist mid-strike.

Ritsu felt a surge of power erupt from within, a blue and white aura shimmering around him. Understanding flooded his mind: He was nothing more than thoughts. The black samurai lunged again, but Ritsu simply placed his palm against the samurai's chest.

Ritsu: "Enough!"

A blinding torrent of white light surged from Ritsu's palm, engulfing the black samurai. His scream, a sound of pure agony, reverberated through the valley as his form dissolved into nothingness. The terror vanished, leaving only a profound stillness.

Knowing his time was at an end, Ritsu settled into the lotus position and closed his eyes. A blinding white light consumed the valley, swallowing all color in its radiant embrace. Tora's face, etched with love and sorrow, flickered briefly in his mind before he, too, faded into the nothingness from which he came.
