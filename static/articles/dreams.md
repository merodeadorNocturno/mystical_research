The valley unfolds like a painting brushed with breath and mist. Early summer dew glistens on the yeddo spruces and rice paddies, where a century of silence is now broken by a dark figure. Standing at the edge of the earthen slopes – an emerald cradle – stands a person, nearly seven feet tall, clad in black samurai armor and wielding a naginata, his face hidden behind a red Oni mask. He gazes down at the valley, his breath spurting out in thick, gray plumes as he begins to descend toward the village nestled by the river below.

Early sunlight spills gold through the clouds, only to be dissolved into a muted twilight as it bathes the Jizō statues lining the main road to the village.
Tora (とら) was already cooking breakfast for herself and her brother, Ritsu (りつ). Without warning, Ritsu snatched a zaru (a bamboo colander) and, with lightning speed, swung it toward Tora's head. Without even glancing back, Tora unfurled a makisu (a bamboo mat), catching the zaru mid-swing. As siblings in their late teens, they found endless amusement in testing each other's martial arts prowess.

Tora smirked without stopping her cooking. "You still lack speed, Ritsu." She swung the zaru back at him, and he barely dodged it.

Ritsu Ducked dramatically. "Whoa! Hey! Just warming up, Big Sis! Don't get cocky!"

"You're getting better, Ritsu," she said, smiling. "But you still need to work on your balance." She paused, her eyes briefly closing as she assessed the aroma of the cooking dish with a practiced sniff.

Ritsu deepened his voice dramatically, imitating Tora’s serious tone. “You still lack speed, Ritsu… And oooh, you still need to work on your balance!”

Tora chuckled softly, her attention fixed on the sizzling food. She gave it a quick taste and nodded in approval. “Hmm. Your 'footwork' is getting better. But you're still wobbling like a newborn fawn.” Her smirk curved upwards as she glanced at him.

With an exaggerated flourish, Ritsu struck a dramatic pose, arms flailing wildly. “Still wobbling like a newborn fawn~! Yeah, yeah, I heard you loud and clear!” He rolled his eyes but couldn’t help grinning at her cheeky jab.

Tora chuckled again, shaking her head. “Heh. Just like Father used to say about—”

Her words caught in her throat as a distant cacophony erupted in the village. Screams and shouts collided into a heart-wrenching symphony of terror, shattering the fragile peace of the morning.

“What was that?!” Ritsu’s grin vanished, replaced by a hard, focused look. “Bandits?! No… there’s something else.” His voice faltered as he processed the escalating commotion. He snapped his head up, instantly alert.

Tora raised a hand, her fingers signaling him to stay silent. Narrowing her eyes, she assessed the situation with sharp precision. The tension in the air made her words come out low and urgent. “Swords!”

They raced into their bedroom, shoved tables aside to reveal a false wall, and grabbed their katanas.
Then both siblings burst out of the house, their swords glinting in the morning light amidst the chaos and confusion.

The siblings sprang into action, swiftly dispatching four bandits who stood in their way.

Tora’s gaze swept over the chaos unfolding before them, her eyes sharp and calculating. “Ritsu! The east path! Get the villagers out, NOW!” Her voice carried authority as she gestured toward the safest route. “Lead as many as you can out of the village. I’ll buy you time.”

Ritsu froze for a split second, his grip tightening around the hilt of his sword. His heart thudded in his chest as he looked at his sister. “Just… don’t get yourself killed, Big Sis,” he said, his voice faltering with hesitation.

Without turning her head, Tora’s reply came swift and resolute, her tone as sharp as her blade. “Just go!”

Amidst the chaos, Ritsu led roughly fifteen people through the east side of the village, while Tora held off the bandits on the other side.
As Ritsu and the others reached the outskirts of the village, their escape was cut off by the towering black samurai. Ritsu watched in horror as the samurai slaughtered five people with a single sweep of his naginata.

Ritsu’s voice rang out above the chaos, commanding the villagers with desperate urgency. “Spread out and flee! Don’t look back! Don’t look back!” His eyes scanned the fleeing crowd, ensuring his words drove them to safety as the screams echoed around him.

The people scattered, their screams echoing through the village.
Ritsu adopted a fighting stance, ready to face the samurai. The black samurai, seemingly unfazed by Ritsu's presence, exhaled a stream of vaporous breath in thick, gray plumes.

The samurai swept his naginata through the air, the blade missing Ritsu by mere millimeters. The force of the stroke cleaved a Jizō statue in two behind him.
Then the samurai attacked again, this time aiming for Ritsu's head. Ritsu deflected the blow with his katana, but the force behind the samurai's strike was overwhelming.

The samurai moved—an impossible blur of motion. Ritsu gasped, his body tensing as he tried to process what he had just witnessed. “Tch! So fast…! And that power…!” He felt his chest tighten, every fiber of his being screaming in protest.

Ritsu stumbled backward, his katana slipping from his grasp. For a moment, he closed his eyes. His mind flashed with fleeting images—a memory of Tora’s confident smirk as she trained him, their father’s steady, guiding voice. No… I can’t… I have to protect them. His resolve hardened as his eyes snapped open, blazing with determination.

He charged at the black samurai. With a burst of speed, he managed to slash the samurai's shoulder.

Ritsu staggered backward, his eyes widening in disbelief as he stared at the unscathed black samurai. His voice trembled with shock as the realization hit him. “What?! It barely scratched him! I have never seen such power before.” His grip on the hilt of his sword tightened as doubt began to creep into his mind.

The black samurai retaliated, striking Ritsu's chest with the naginata's shaft and sending him flying backward. Ritsu crashed to the ground, his katana still clutched in his hand. The black samurai advanced, eager to end the fight, and unleashed a sweeping blow at the fallen warrior.
Midair, Tora's katana flashed, intercepting the samurai's attack. She unleashed a flurry of strikes, each aimed at a different vital point. The samurai parried each blow, but Tora's speed and agility kept him on the defensive. Ritsu, now back on his feet, rejoined the fray.

Tora landed with precision between Ritsu and the black samurai, her katana flashing as it deflected the incoming blow. A playful grin spread across her face as she glanced back at her brother. “Leaving me out of all the fun, Ritsu?” she teased, her tone light despite the tension in the air. Her smirk deepened as she added, “And really? Didn’t we just talk about keeping your feet planted, Little Brother?”

The black samurai stood his ground against the two siblings. He swept his naginata low, aiming for Tora's legs – only for her to cleave the weapon in two with a single stroke of her katana.

Ritsu’s jaw dropped as Tora cleaved the black samurai’s naginata in two with a single, fluid stroke. “Whoa! Nice one, Sis!” he shouted, his voice brimming with awe and adrenaline. He saw an opportunity to strike the samurai's exposed neck. He lunged forward, his katana poised to deliver the final blow, but the samurai made a quick move and hit Ritsu's neck with the shaft that was still in his hand, sending him flying backward, again.

Tora’s triumph was short-lived as she watched Ritsu take a devastating hit, his body crashing to the ground. Her heart clenched, and a sharp cry escaped her lips. “Ritsu! Dammit!”

With a swift move, Tora seized the samurai's wrist, wrenching the bladed head of the broken naginata from his grasp.
But the black samurai was not done. He picked up the cleaved Jizō statue and tossed it in Tora's direction, aiming for her head. Tora dodged it, but it still stroked her shoulder and her chest, sending her down.

The black samurai stalked toward Tora, seizing her throat in his grip and lifting her off the ground. She clawed at his hand, but he held her aloft, his grip unyielding. For the first time, she saw his eyes – twin embers of burning rage. Then, a mystical realization washed over her as she gazed into the depths of that brutal fury: she ceased her struggle, flooding her spirit with inner peace.

Ritsu awoke to see the black samurai throttling Tora. Fueled by a surge of hatred and love for his sister, he scrambled to his feet, snatched up his katana and the bladed head of the naginata, and charged.

Ritsu screamed as he charged toward the black samurai, his fury boiling over into a desperate roar. “LET HER GOOOOO!” He thrust the naginata blade toward the samurai's chest, aiming for his heart, then swung his katana, attempting to sever the arm that gripped Tora's throat. But all was for naught: the naginata blade pierced the samurai's heart, yet the katana's strike failed to so much as scratch his arm – as if his flesh were forged from the strongest steel. "NANI?! Impossible! My blade... it didn't even..!".

With his free hand, the black samurai delivered a crushing blow to Ritsu's gut, leaving him gasping for air on his knees. A dismissive grunt escaped the Samurai's mouth.

Tora, struggling to breathe, turned her gaze toward Ritsu, tears streaming down her face.Her voice trembled as she struggled to speak, her strength waning with every breath. Tears streamed down her face as she turned her gaze toward Ritsu. “Ritsu… I’m sorry,” she whispered, her words laced with regret. “I didn’t see this sooner.”

Ritsu’s shoulders trembled as he gripped his katana, his body fueled by a whirlwind of anger and sorrow. He glanced at his sister, his voice breaking under the weight of his despair. “Tora… I’m sorry,” he whispered, the words dripping with guilt. “I couldn’t save you… He’s too strong.”

Tora's grip on reality seemed to slip as her urgency grew, her tone fading but sharp with conviction. “Ritsu, I understand now… This is all just a dream.” She paused, her voice faltering as the realization consumed her. “You and I… we’re nothing more than characters in someone else’s dream.”

Ritsu’s voice faltered, heavy with sorrow and confusion, as he stared at Tora. His thoughts swirled in disbelief, struggling to grasp her words. “What…?” The single word escaped his lips, quiet and fractured, as if carrying the weight of his despair.

The black samurai tightened his grip, his fingers digging into Tora's throat.

Tora’s breath came in shallow, labored gasps as she mustered the last of her strength. Her trembling lips parted, and her voice, weak but resolute, reached Ritsu like a fading echo. “Ritsu… it’s a dream… anything is possible…”

With a sickening crack that echoed through the valley, the black samurai's grip slackened, her body falling limp in his grasp. His voice, distorted and inhuman, rumbled through the chaos like a thunderclap. “Weak,” he growled, the single word dripping with contempt as he cast her aside without a second glance.

Ritsu’s eyes widened in sheer horror, his breath catching as the scene unfolded before him. Grief consumed him, tearing through his chest as he staggered forward. “TORAAAAAAAAAAAAA!” The anguished scream ripped from his throat, echoing through the chaos like a desperate plea to the heavens.

Ritsu’s lips moved silently at first, his breath hitching as the realization sank in. His whispered words barely broke through the chaos surrounding him. “It’s just a dream… It’s just a dream…” His voice cracked, trembling with both fear and a faint glimmer of hope. “I’m just a part of it… I’m just a part of it…” He closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and released his pain and fear, just as his sister had taught him years before.

The black samurai turned toward Ritsu and delivered a powerful blow aimed at his head. When Ritsu opened his eyes again, he found, inexplicably, that he had caught the black samurai’s fist mid-strike.

Ritsu felt a surge of power erupt from within, a blue and white aura shimmering around him. Understanding flooded his mind. The black samurai lunged again, but Ritsu simply placed his palm against the samurai's chest.

Ritsu steadied himself, his trembling breath transforming into a calm, unyielding force. Clenching his katana tightly, he locked eyes with the black samurai, his voice cutting through the tension like a blade. “Owari da.” The word carried all his fury, his sorrow, and his determination, resonating in the stillness that followed.

A blinding torrent of white light surged from Ritsu's palm, engulfing the black samurai. His scream, a sound of pure agony, reverberated through the valley as his form dissolved into nothingness.

Knowing his time was at an end, Ritsu settled into the lotus position and closed his eyes. A blinding white light consumed the valley, swallowing all color in its radiant embrace.
